import React from 'react';

const WorkText01 = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                In this section you can view all the areas in which I can put my abilities into use.
                For an easy visualization I decided to divide the field of my skills into three sections:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
};

export default WorkText01;
