                Hello! My name is Nicol√≤ Tommasi. I was born in 1982 in Verona, Italy, and more precisely in San Michele Extra. I had a normal childhood, with hiking, biking, kicking the ball and, sometimes, popping a few firecrackers. During my educational development, I immediately identified music, painting and computer science (especially the development branch) as my main interests.
                I started playing guitar when I was very young, fascinated by a live video of Black Sabbath on the telly. Having been in contact with guys who shared the same passion, I formed the first rock band almost immediately.
                From that moment on I never stopped playing and composing music, until today. Thanks to it I have been able to learn and improve languages, especially English, developing a real passion for idioms and jargon.
                Music was not the only determining factor in language learning, in fact it was also thanks to video games that I greatly expanded my vocabulary skills.
