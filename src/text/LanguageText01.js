            Given my expertise in the language field, I offer various services including written translation of texts and support in learning an idiom (I may also be available to participate in tandem sessions). I am familiar with tools like Deepl, Google Translate and text editors such as Ms Word and Open Office.
            Here a brief overview of my language skills level (with the exception of italian, which is my mothertongue):
            </p>
        </div>
    )

export default LanguageText01;
