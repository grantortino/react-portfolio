                Over the years I have used the computer intensively to create images, posters and, in a couple of cases, websites for my projects. This has allowed me to become familiar with the main software and operating systems.
                I lived in Verona until the age of 26 with my father (now deceased) and my mother. In 2008 I packed my bags and moved to Berlin, where I still live today.
                In 2010 I discovered the <a href="http://www.dhamma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vipassana</a> meditation technique which led me to undertake an intense and very rewarding volunteer path. For this reason I lived and travelled for three years between various meditation centres in Europe and India.
                My goal now is to finish a training course as a web developer and then look for work, with the prospect of travelling and working where I prefer, settling in more places, absorbing their culture and language.
